# Implementation Verify Skill

Runs the repo's verification, then shows a summary of changes for user review.
This is the human control point before commit.

## Usage

```
/implementation-verify <issue-number>
```

## Workflow

1. **Verify:** `npm run build` — must succeed. It must NEVER
   silently pass; report the real result.
- **Theming:** confirm no hardcoded color values — components must use the CSS
  custom properties / `@derekwinters/design-tokens` (runtime themes override
  them). See `src/__tests__/designTokens.test.js`.

2. **Prepare a changes summary:** `git diff --stat`; list files modified with
   line counts; summarize the implementation; include the test/verify results.
3. **Pause:** wait for the user to Approve for commit / Request changes / Abort.

## Parameters

- `issue_number` (optional): for reference in the output.

## Notes

- Called by the orchestrator after tests pass.
- Shows all changes before the user reviews; the user has the control point here.
